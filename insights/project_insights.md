### Implications

1. **Conversion Rate**: The conversion rate shows how effectively the platform turns engaged users into paying customers. A low conversion rate could suggest the need for better targeting or improved marketing strategies.
2. **Engagement Time**: A long gap between registration and first engagement might indicate that students are not immediately seeing the value in the platform. A shorter gap could suggest better onboarding or more appealing content.
3. **Purchase Timing**: The time between engagement and purchase provides insights into how quickly users are motivated to subscribe. Understanding this time window is important for improving the user experience and maximizing conversion.
